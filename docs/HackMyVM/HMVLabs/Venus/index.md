Hello hax0r,
Welcome to the HMVLab Chapter 1: Venus!
This is a CTF for beginners where you can practice your skills with Linux and CTF
so lets start! :)
First of all, the home of each user is in /pwned/USER and in it you will find a file called mission.txt which will contain
the mission to complete to get the password of the next user.
It will also contain the flagz.txt file, which if you are registered at https://hackmyvm.eu you can enter to participate in the ranking (optional).
And for a bit of improvisation, there are secret levels and hidden flags: D
You will not have write permissions in most folders so if you need to write a script or something
use /tmp folder, keep in mind that it is frequently deleted ...

And last (and not least) some users can modify the files that are in the
folder /www, these files are accessible from http://venus.hackmyvm.eu so if you get a user
that can modify the file /www/hi.txt, you can put a message and it will be reflected in http://venus.hackmyvm.eu/hi.txt.

If you have questions/ideas or want to comment us anything you can join
to our Discord: https://discord.gg/DxDFQrJ

Remember there are more people playing so be respectful.
Hack & Fun!
```
